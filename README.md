# Twitter Clone - React Project

## Overview

This project is a Twitter clone developed in React, created with the aim of practicing and honing my skills in front-end web development using React.js. Being this was my first time developing with React, I followed a YouTube tutorial on Clever Programmer's channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJjaqSTzOxI) As one of the most popular social media platforms, Twitter offers a wide range of features and complexities that make it an excellent candidate for a real-world-like practice project. 

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Sign up, log in, and log out functionalities to create and manage user accounts. This was not part of the original YouTube tutorial but I wanted to practice my skills and go a little further. 
- **Compose Tweets:** Users can write and post new tweets to share their thoughts and updates.

## Tech Stack

- React.js - Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- Firebase - Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform for user authentication and real-time database.
- CSS - Styling and layout design.
